NT4C stands for "NestedText for C" and that is exactly what this project is
about.


## What is NestedText ##########################################################

In short, NestedText is a file format for holding structured data.

## What is NT4C

NT4C is a NestedText parser implementation written in accordance with the C23
standard of the C programming language. It includes the following features:

* **Compliance:** NT4C aims to comply with the latest version of the
  [NestedText specification](https://nestedtext.org/). However, it is currently
  only partially compliant with the
  [Minimal NestedText](https://nestedtext.org/en/latest/minimal-nestedtext.html)
  specification.

* **Performance:** NT4C is fast as it does not involve any heap memory
  allocations. It also avoids unnecessary memory copying by directly referencing
  the input text in the resulting graph.

* **Compactness:** The NT4C parser is implemented in a single header file with
  no dependencies other than the standard C library.

* **Embedding:** The NT4C parser is easy to reuse in other projects, with a
  straightforward API that consists of just one function, `nt_parse()`.

* **Tree model:** NT4C parses the entire document and constructs a graph (DOM)
  where each node directly references a segment from the input string.

* **Portability:** NT4C builds and functions on Linux. It should be relatively
  simple to make it run on most other platforms as long as the platform provides
  the C standard library.

* **Encoding:** NT4C expects UTF-8 encoding of the input text and does not
  attempt to detect Unicode encoding errors.

* **Permissive license:** NT4C is available under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
